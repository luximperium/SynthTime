## Usage

### Profile

### Sequencer

The real meat of the program though is in the sequencer tab. In this tab, you can create a little melody, as well as be able to save and reload melodies. 

To create a melody, simply select the note you want a checkbox to play next to the corresponding checkbox, as well as check the checkbox, and hit play! If you want to change the melody, you can stop the sequencer, update the melody, and replay!
